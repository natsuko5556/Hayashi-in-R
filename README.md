# Hayashi-in-R

This project will include the R realization of empirical studies for Hayashi's <Economtrics>. All the data could be downloaded in Professor Hayashi's webpage:"https://sites.google.com/view/fumio-hayashis-hp/hayashi-econometrics?authuser=0". Or use the R package: hayashir, which could be found in "https://github.com/jmbejara/bfi-reu-2019".

This project is a exercise for me to handle r coding when package is not used. I am a novice of R and econometrics. If my code is weird or full of bugs, please inform me and let me know. Thank you for your advice.
